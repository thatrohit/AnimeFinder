#This query gets the details of selected anime from search screen
#Here preventing multiple round trip is showcased
#From one graph query, we are querying paginated Review, Media, MediaTrend, Review and Studio
#If we had to use REST then we would have to chain the following requests
#media/<id>
#mediatrend/<mediaid>
#studio/<mediaid>
#Only once we make these three api calls, we could render the details on our screen
